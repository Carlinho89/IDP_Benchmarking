            <h2></h2>
            <p>The following documentation explains how to retrieve data and manage the database for the project BenchMarking of Soccer Teams. At the moment the database holds informations on the four main european leagues 
            (Italian, English, Spanish, German) from year 2010 until 2015(partial). The data for season 2015 will be used as study case to show how to update the content. Furthermore an explanation on how to create the whole db from scratch will be given.</p>

          <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="well">
          The parsers are written in PHP and store the data in a MySQL database. Once populated the db can be exported to an sql file and then imported in the h2 database used by the Play application. 
          The following steps assume that your machine can run PHP scripts and can connect to a running MySQL database. The easiest way is to install the XAMPP (for Windows, check LAMPP or MAMPP for other OS) distribution which gives both on a local Apache server.

          <div class="well">
            The football data has been gathered from two web pages of soccer statistics:
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>whoscored.com:</b> this page has been used to parse most of the inputs regarding  sportive data (ex: ball possession, games won,..). The content from this web site has been cached locally since there was no recognizable pattern in the url; it is saved in the html files handed out with the parser.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>transfermarkt.com:</b> this page was used to parse the social and monetary values for the teams. The data here is crawled directly from the web source since it was easy to iterate through the actual urls in order to get data from different years in a single parse.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Notice that the use of different sources also implies a phase of transformation of the data: most of the teams have different names in the two websites and surprisingly also transfermarkt doesn't have a fixed naming for teams among it's own pages. 
              To overcome the problem the teams from transfermarkt have been saved with their id which, luckily enough, is saved as an attribute to the link holding the logo of the team.

                          2 remarks:
                          <li>
                            Consistency: the file is using a static and an online source to compare the rank of teams. This means that the last results_league_year.html files (at the moment the ones where year = 2015) should be exactly up to the date for the match to work (example if Barcelona was second at the moment in which the html was saved and is now first the two ranks wont match).
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            TM error: unfortunately the two websites don't agree on all final ranks. If you take a look at the final rank for years 2011 in Spain the two websites have a different order for teams with the same points at the end of the season. To overcome this problem some 'Insert' statements have been hardcoded at the end of the file. We know this is a bad practice but it was the only way to keep the process automatic.
                          </li>

            <p class="well">
              As explained previously some of the html content has been saved in local files to be parsed easily. Stats from 2010 to 2014 are saved already but if you want to update data from 2015 or any new season follow the next steps. The example considers only one league, repeat the same steps for the other leagues also.

                  Click on Defensive, wait for the data to load. Repeat the operation for the Offensive tab. This step is fundamental for the source code to display all the information we want to parse. Keep this in mind if you decide to add other pages to parse: some data are only loaded asynchronously after an event (click in our case) so we have to trigger the event in order to have the data in the source code.

                 Launch the php file tm_stadiums.php. This will parse a list of links to stadiums data from different major and minor leagues. Minor leagues where needed here because transfermarkt doesn't organize this data by season: there is only information on the actual season so all teams that in the last six years have left major league should be found in the minor leagues. If you are adding new teams, remember to also add links to the league it comes from at the top of this file in order to get it's stadium capacity input.

              The complete database is saved in the benchmarkingfootballteams.sql file and  can be easily imported in any sql database. This is the fastest way to populate the data. 
              The project, though, will be over before the 2015-2016 season will end. If you want to add up to date information on this season follow the steps in the Populating HTML section and run the parsers again. 
              Notice: in order for the update to work first delete all existing data from season 2015 by running <code>DELETE FROM `seasonal_data` WHERE `year` = 2015</code> in the sql console then run the scripts.

                The two sources present data in different ways so different approaches have been used for parsing.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li class="well">
                <h3>whoscored</h3>
                <p>
                  The html files already have some values which are not parsed. The web page also has other tables which have not been taken in consideration. In both cases by looking at the php parsers and reading this section it should be easy to understand how to proceed.<br>
                  Vertical Parsing:<br>
                  Tables in whoscored have a first column which holds team names and other columns holding values for different kinds of inputs. Luckily the class of the cell (td) in the sourcecode can be used to parse the contents. As example take one results_LEAGUENAME_YEAR.html file. You can notice that every "td" (html tag for a table's cell) has a class describing the content (tn= team name, p=played, w=won, d=draw ecc). The parser creates a first array holding team names by looking for td with class tn (team names) with the getTeams() method. Sequently a copy of the resulting array is passed to every call to the parseInput() method which also takes as parameter the class of the input we want to parse (ex w for wins). <br>
                  The approach is generic and can work for any numeric valued input written  on the page. Some tables may have different elements inside the td: look at red cards in the stats_summary_parser.php.<br>

                </p>
              </li>

              <li class="well">

                <p>
                  Only a couple of pages were parsed from this web site. But having saved the id of each team in the database (through tm_conversion.php) parsing any other page should be easy, as long as it has the team logo (that's where the team id is stored).<br>
                  Horizontal Parsing:<br>
                 The data in these tables was not described by a class attribute stating which value each cell is holding. For this reason instead of parsing one column (input) at the time for multiple teams we parse multiple inputs for one row (team) at a time. The different inputs are recognized by their positon in the row.. <br>
