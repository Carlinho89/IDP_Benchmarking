                    To evaluate the performance of a DMU over multiple time periods, the Malmquist Index (MQI) can be used.

                    It compares the performances of two time periods and quantifies the changes between them.

                    The Malmquist index is a product of two components: The Catch-up term, which measures the efficiency change of one particular DMU within the sample, and the Frontier-shift term which quantifies the shift in the whole sampleâ€™s production frontier. Hence, it is a comparative measure for the development of a DMUs performance in relation to the performance-shift of the whole sample.

                    In the simple case of one input and one output, the MQI is calculated as follows [29]:

                    P stands for the considered DMU's input/output-combination in period 1, while Q stands for its input/output-combination in the second period.
